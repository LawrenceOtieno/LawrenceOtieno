Hello, I'm @LawrenceOtieno
I am a professional in: IT Operations, IT Support, Data Analytics, and Business Analysis. 
Currently, I am enhancing my python skills, with hands-on experience in data analysis, web dev, and automation. I am also taking a part-time course on Coursera, "Google Data Analytics" to be specific. This will help me understand the Data Analysis process, and Data life cycle more. 
I am actively applying my skills to solve real-world challenges and streamline processes. Let's collaborate.

Fun fact: "My favorite music is country and evening walks combination, this helps me unwind thus keeping me focused."
